# Testing remarks

At the moment, testing is done by hand. Ideally, testing is automated using [snapshot testing](https://pypi.org/project/snapshottest)

## Directory structure

We have a "tests" directory where test data is stored. Each folder represents an exported ReMarkable notebook file.

- `tests/in` stores ReMarkable notebook files. Each directory represents one notebook
- `tests/out` is a directory which stores the PDF and markdown files generated by remarks. 
   This directory can be cleared whenever you wish.

## Verifying a behavior

Simply run remarks `python -m remarks tests/in/MY_TEST_NOTEBOOK tests/out` and look at the generated files in the `tests/out` directory

## Checklist before release

- Ensure epub/pdf based notebooks with inserted pages are rendered correctly
  - [ ] Run remarks over `pdf_with_multiple_added_pages`
  - [ ] The document has 6 pages in total
  - [ ] Pages 1, 3 and 6 are pdf pages containing lorem ipsum text as well as the page number written on them
  - [ ] Pages 2, 4 and 5 are inserted pages with the page number written on them

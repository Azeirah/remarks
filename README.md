# remarks

Extract your marks (highlights, scribbles, annotations) and convert them to `Markdown`, `PDF`, `PNG`, and `SVG`. 

`remarks` works with PDFs annotated on [reMarkableâ„¢ paper tablets](https://remarkable.com).

# Overview

Highlight and annotate PDFs with your Marker on your reMarkable device:

# Setup and usage

Because `remarks` depends only on [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) and [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely), there is no need to install `imagemagick`, `opencv`, or any additional image library. 

Please note that `remarks` is still highly experimental software. So far, it has been tested only with reMarkable (software version) `2.2.0.48` on `macOS Catalina`. But because there are just two dependencies, I expect it to be easy to install and use on Linux and Windows too.

## 1. Copy files from the `xochitl` directory to your computer

_Check out my [reMarkable command-line utils](https://github.com/lucasrla/rm-utils) for a SSH & rsync setup that is very convenient._

Alternatively, you can use the good old `scp` to copy files from the device to your computer:

On your reMarkable device, go to `Menu > Settings > About`, then under the `Copyrights and Licenses` tab, scroll down the `General Information` text. Right after the paragraph titled "GPLv3 Compliance", there will be the username (`root`), password and IP address needed for `SSH`.

Using these credentials, `scp` the contents of `/home/root/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl` from your reMarkable to a directory on your computer. It may take a while depending on the size of your document collection and the quality of your wifi network.

You probably want to switch off the Auto sleep feature in `Menu > Settings > Power` before transferring the files to prevent any unintented interruptions.

## 2. Clone, install and run `remarks`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucasrla/remarks.git

cd remarks

pyenv virtualenv remarks && pyenv local remarks
# or your tool of choice for managing environments

poetry install
# or your tool of choice for managing dependencies
# for example:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# if you use pip, please note that requirements.txt in this repo was created with:
# poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt

# run the demo
python -m remarks demo/xochitl demo/output

# read what additional flags are available
python -m remarks --help

# some other examples
python -m remarks ~/backups/remarkable/xochitl/ test/ --ann_type highlights --targets md
python -m remarks ~/backups/remarkable/xochitl/ test/ --ann_type scribbles --targets png
```

# remarks

Extract your marks (highlights, scribbles, annotations) and convert them to `Markdown`, `PDF`, `PNG`, and `SVG`. 

`remarks` works with PDFs annotated on [reMarkableâ„¢ paper tablets](https://remarkable.com).

Please note that `remarks` is still highly experimental software. In any case, pull requests are warmly welcome!


# Some use cases

## In: PDF highlighted on reMarkable | Out: PDF with parseable highlights
Someone who highlights lots of PDFs (e.g., academics) can export their highlights and process them in a reference management tool, like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) ([#2](https://github.com/lucasrla/remarks/issues/2#issuecomment-732166093)).

## Extract highlighted text to Markdown
Infovores of the world can export highlighted text to [.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files that can be imported into their preferred "tool for networked thought", like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com).

## Export annotated pages to full-page images
Sometimes having just the textual content is not enough, sometimes you need the actual (visual) context around your annotation. To help you in such situations, `remarks` can export each annotated PDF page to a [.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) file. After that, these images can be, for example, embedded to your "tool for networked thought".


# A visual example

Highlight and annotate PDFs with your Marker on your reMarkable tablet:

And then use `remarks` to export annotated pages to `Markdown`, `PDF`, `PNG`, or `SVG` on your computer.

`PDF`:

- The `--combined_pdf` flag outputs an all-in-one `PDF` file (the original `PDF` with all annotated pages).
- The `--targets pdf` flag outputs a directory with single-page `PDF` files for each annotated page.

`PNG`:

`Markdown`:

> <mark>WHAT IS LIFE?</mark>
> 
> Based on lectures delivered under the auspices of the <mark>Dublin Institute for</mark> <mark>Advanced Studies at Trinity College,</mark> Dublin, in February 1943
> 
> <mark>To</mark>
> <mark>the memory of My</mark> <mark>Parents</mark>

`SVG`:

- Please note that the `SVG` image file includes only the annotations, not the original PDF content.


# Setup

Although I expect `remarks` to be easy to install and use on Linux and Windows, so far it has been used only on a macOS Catalina computer and a ([1st generation](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable)) reMarkable tablet with software versions `2.2.0.48`, `2.3.0.16`, and `2.4.1.30`.

Because `remarks` depends only on [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF), [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely), and Python 3.8+, there is no need to install `imagemagick`, `opencv`, or any additional image library. If [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF) is available on your computer, `remarks` may (optionally) use it.

## 1. Copy files from the `xochitl` directory to your computer

I find using `rsync` the easiest way to copy files from/to your reMarkable tablet. Check out the repository [lucasrla/remarkable-utils](https://github.com/lucasrla/remarkable-utils) for the SSH & `rsync` setup I use (which includes automatic backups based on `cron`). 

Alternatively, you can use the good old `scp` to copy files from the tablet to your computer:

- On your reMarkable tablet, go to `Menu > Settings > Help > About`, then tap on `Copyrights and licenses`. In `General information`, right after the section titled "GPLv3 Compliance", there will be the username (`root`), password and IP addresses needed for `SSH`.

- Using these credentials, `scp` the contents of `/home/root/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl` from your reMarkable to a directory on your computer. (Copying may take a while depending on the size of your document collection and the quality of your wifi network.)

- To prevent any unintented interruptions, you can (optionally) switch off the `Auto sleep` feature in `Menu > Settings > Battery` before transferring your files.

## 2. Clone this repository and install the dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucasrla/remarks.git

cd remarks

pyenv virtualenv remarks && pyenv local remarks
# Or your tool of choice for managing environments

poetry install
# Or your tool of choice for managing dependencies (e.g., pip)

# pip install -r requirements.txt
# If you use pip, note that the requirements.txt file was created via:
# poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt
```


# Usage & Demo

Run `remarks` and check out what arguments are available:

```sh
python -m remarks --help
```

Next, for a quick hands-on experience of `remarks`, run the demo:

```sh
# Alan Turing's 1936 foundational paper (with a few highlights and scribbles)

# Original PDF file downloaded from:
# "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"
# https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230

python -m remarks demo/on-computable-numbers/xochitl demo/on-computable-numbers --targets png md pdf --combined_pdf
```

A few other examples:

```sh
# Assuming your `xochitl` files are at `~/backups/remarkable/xochitl/`

python -m remarks ~/backups/remarkable/xochitl/ example_1/ --ann_type highlights --targets md --combined_pdf

python -m remarks ~/backups/remarkable/xochitl/ example_2/ --targets png
```
